# __An Adaptation from the Paper Measuring Corporate Culture Using Machine Learning by Datellus__

The following files shows how to execute the instructions from the following repository: https://github.com/MS20190155/Measuring-Corporate-Culture-Using-Machine-Learning . The original repository was from 2020, therefore there have been changes in the way we need to execute the code, especially in the way we load de __Stanford Core NLP__ .

## __Cloning the Repo__

First you need to clone this repo. It has the same files as the original with some minor changes. You can do this by using __git clone__.

## __Most Important Change : Installing Stanza__

The original repository uses the __StanfordNLP Module__ however it outputs an error of timeout. ThatÂ´s why we need to install __Stanza__. You can find the instructions in here https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/installation_usage#installation. 

After installing __Stanza__ you need to download __Stanford Core NLP__. Thankfully, Stanza does this for us
